				<p>
					Present App 2020 is a comprehensive system able to manage presentations by students of Murdoch University including the ability to record assessors’ details and feedback. Additionally, the system provides lecturers of Murdoch University with a central source of information to allow for the development of presentation skills among its students.

					<br><br>

					The features, functions and major benefits of the Present App system are explained below:

					<br><br>
					
					● Structure and systematically organize presentations.<br>
					● Provides a flexible, automated and interactive interface between the web application and users.<br>
					● Helps to increase productivity by reducing the amount of paperwork in assessing presentations.<br>
					● Helps to build and sustan relationships between presenters and their audiences.<br>

					<br>

					We are a team of computer science majors with no web development experience. In spite of that, we hope that our version of Present App 2020 exceeds the works of those who do. 

					<br><br>

					You're welcome.
